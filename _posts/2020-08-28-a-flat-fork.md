A trip out to an old common destination, Flat Fork Park.  This is a very nice park situated pretty close to home with wide walking paths that are cycling friendly, gravel paths, ponds with fishing docks, a giant hill to climb, dirt trails from beginner level to slightly advanced, a trail that's more of a bmx trail, a walking bridge, wooden structures off the ground for picnics and a higher vantage point view of the park, a creek bottom (that my dog loves by the way), picnic tables, restrooms, and a lot of trees.  The trails aren't long trails, but the more advanced areas have several obstacles.

I tackled the Ringer Road climb two more times.  My speed on this climb was at 15.3 MPH on the first pass, I have no idea how the leader of this ride hit 29 MPH.  The only thing I can think of is that scene from one of those *Back to the Future* movies, where they're on their hover boards holding on to the bumper of a car and then letting go after they get to speed.  Who knows... maybe they're just a little more awesome.
