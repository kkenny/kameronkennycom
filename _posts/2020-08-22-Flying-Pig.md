# The Flying Pig

Ears to the sky and flapping in the wind, it's clear from the map that I'm approaching mastery in the art of drawing with my bicycle.

Overall was a fun ride, exploring new roads that I've never touched prior to this ride.  A few moments existed to zoom out the map at a stop sign and decide which direction to head next, which is possibly the best part of a ride like this -- not knowing what lies ahead or what is to be discovered next.  While this ride landed me on a stretch of road that was freshely graveled in preparation for the next layer of smooth surface the come, I still pedaled forward.  I can't wait until this road is paved, it will certainly be a new frequently traveled segment.

Speaking of segments... I took two passes at the Ringer Road Climb.  This little climb is one I stumbled upon not too long ago that is a fun hill that pushes, but isn't too tall to make you give up.  This climb comes in at 33ft at a 7% grade, lasting for .08 (Yes, that's eight one-hundredths of a mile).  It's funny how my best attempt on this challenge lasted for 21 seconds, only 10 seconds behind the leader, but I'm still ranked at 142!
