**Distance**: 35.37 mi | **Moving Time**: 02:31:46 | **Elevation Gain**: 531 ft | **Bike**: Giant TCR

July's goal was 250, but adjusted to 200 due to a tire setback.  Closed out July with 207.88 miles in 14 rides.  I know... there's a lot of people who will acomplish this in a week, but I'm happy :)

200 Miles wasn't the only goal hit on this ride. The other goal hit was my goal to hit under 20 minute 5 mile lap.  First hit at 18:57!
