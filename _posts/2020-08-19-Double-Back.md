A flock of not-so angry geese -- Which was a nice change from the hissing goose that was approaching me a few weeks ago up the hill from a pond.  I have to admit, when I rounded the corner and saw all of those geese in the field, there was a small part of me that wanted to turn around... but I pushed through it. The worst case scenario is nightmares of geese flocking at me while hissing and trapping me right before I wake up in sweats wondering what just happened... right?

### Ringer Climb
I took two passes on the Ringer Climb this time.  Maybe at this rate I'll get the title of Local Legent soon?
